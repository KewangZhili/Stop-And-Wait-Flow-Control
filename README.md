 Stop and wait protocol used to send 10 messages 
 **RUN BOTH sender.cpp and recepient.cpp simultaneously**

It helps flow control by::
1.As it ensures that the message delivered by the sender receives the recepient hence a flow control is maintained
**IN OUR PROGRAM ,I'M SENDING 10 MESSAGES;AND IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO RDT -3.0  **
	1.IN THE THIRD MESSAGE THE ACK IS LOST SO A RETRANSMISSION OCCRUS 
	2.INSTEAD OF SENDING AN INTEGER IN THE 6TH MESSAGE(HERE WORKING OF CHECKSUM IS MIMICKED BY CHECKING WHETHER THE MESSAGE IS AN INT OR NOT) I SENT A "?" 
	3.AND TO SIMULATE DELAYED ACK,I'M FORCING A TIMEOUT AT THE 7TH MESSAGE
**THUS ALL 3 CASES OF CONCERN ARE TAKEN CARE HERE**
